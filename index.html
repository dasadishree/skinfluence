                <h2>JOIN OUR TEAM</h2>
                <p>Not ready to lead a chapter? No problem. Join as a team member and support drives, social media, event logistics, volunteer coordination, or research. Roles range from short-term (help at a single drive) to ongoing (social lead, partnerships coordinator, research associate), and we'll match tasks to your schedule and strengths, and match you with our board members. This is a hands-on way to develop project management and communication skills while directly supporting vulnerable communities.</p>

                <h2>START A CHAPTER</h2>
                <p>Want to be the person who brings this to your school or town? As a chapter founder you'll recruit and train your team to plan community events (workshops, health fairs, school lessons) and develop partnerships with clinics, PTAs, and student groups. We at Skinfluence will provide founders a full toolkit-slide templates, outreach support, guidance, etc. - so you don't start from scratch. You'll build leadership experience, make local contacts in healthcare, and create a lasting program that benefits students and families in your community.</p>
